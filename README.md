# Memory Card

This is a project for The Odin Project's React course to build a simple [memory card game](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card) using React. 

For this project, I learned to work with state and side effects, using the useState and useEffect React hooks. I also learned to request API data inside a React app.

**Live Demo:** [https://hp-memory-card-game.vercel.app/](https://hp-memory-card-game.vercel.app/)

## Game Instructions
* Click each card once and only once!
* Watch your current score update after each play and your high score update if you happen to click a card you've already clicked before.
* The highest possible score is 16 (16 cards total to click).
